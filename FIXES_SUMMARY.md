# SAARTHI FEATURES - FINAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Header/Footer Color Inversion Fixed ✅

**Problem**: Header and footer were appearing white regardless of theme mode

**Solution**:
- Updated `Header.js`: 
  - Background: `bg-white dark:bg-black` (white in light mode, black in dark mode)
  - Logo switching: Uses black logo in light mode, white logo in dark mode
  - All text colors and hover states properly themed
  - Theme toggle button colors updated for both modes

- Updated `Footer.js`:
  - Background: `bg-white dark:bg-black` (white in light mode, black in dark mode)  
  - Logo switching: Uses appropriate logos for each theme
  - All text and link colors properly themed

- Added global Header/Footer in `App.js`:
  - Header and Footer now appear on all pages except login
  - Conditional rendering based on route path
  - Removed duplicate Header/Footer from individual page components

### 2. Language Translator Now Works on All Pages ✅

**Problem**: Language changer only worked on home page

**Solution**:
- Restructured `App.js` to include global Header/Footer
- All pages now have access to the language switcher in the footer
- Removed individual Header/Footer imports from page components
- Language context is properly available throughout the entire application

### 3. Translation Keys Fixed for Feature Descriptions ✅

**Problem**: Text boxes in "Why Saarthi?" section were not changing language

**Solution**:
- Fixed translation key generation in `Infor.js`
- Updated `i18n.js` with proper keys for all feature descriptions
- Added missing Marathi translations for all features
- Improved key matching algorithm to handle special characters
